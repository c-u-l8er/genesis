make an interactive HTML, CSS, and JS static site that showcases this process:

The image illustrates the process of **mitosis**, showing a sequence of **five key stages** leading to cell division. The diagram uses **color-coded structures** to depict different cellular components. Here is a detailed breakdown:
**1. Prophase**
* The **chromatin (blue)** condenses into **chromosomes** inside the nucleus.
* **Centrosomes (yellow with small squares)** begin moving to opposite poles of the cell.
* **Microtubules** start forming from the centrosomes.
**2. Prometaphase**
* The **nuclear envelope breaks down**.
* **Spindle fibers (yellow)** extend from the centrosomes and attach to the **kinetochores** on chromosomes.
* The **chromosomes (blue strands)** start aligning in the center.
**3. Metaphase**
* The **chromosomes align along the metaphase plate (center of the cell)**.
* **Spindle fibers (yellow)** from both centrosomes are attached to the **kinetochores** of each chromosome.
**4. Anaphase**
* The **sister chromatids (blue) separate** and are pulled toward opposite poles.
* **Mitotic spindle fibers (yellow lines)** contract, guiding the movement.
**5. Telophase & Cytokinesis**
* **Two new nuclei form**, each containing a complete set of chromosomes.
* The **midbody ring** appears, which helps in final separation.
* The **cell membrane pinches in**, completing cytokinesis and forming **two identical daughter cells**.
**Visual Elements for Interaction**
* **Each phase is labeled with an arrow pointing to the next step.**
* **Chromosomes (blue), microtubules/spindle fibers (yellow), and centrosomes (yellow squares) are clearly distinguished.**
* **Annotations like "kinetochore," "mitotic spindle," and "midbody ring" add further detail.**
This breakdown should help you generate an interactive static site where users can hover over different parts of the image to get descriptions or click to navigate between phases.
